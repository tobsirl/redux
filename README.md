# Redux - [A Predictable State Container for JS Apps](https://redux.js.org/)

## What about React state?
* How to handle state that your whole application needs.
* Lack of organization and clarity

## Guiding Principles
1. A single source of truth ("global state")
2. State is read-only ("actions")
3. Changes are made with pure functions ("reducers")
   
## Fundamentals
1. Actions & action creators
2. Dispatch
3. Reducers
4. Store

## Restaurant Analogy
1. Your Order ➡️ "action"
2. Restaurant server ➡️ "dispatch"
3. Chef ➡️ "reducer"
  
# Another option - [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) 
* Built in state management API.
* Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
